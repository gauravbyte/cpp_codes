/**
Given a positive integer n, find the smallest integer which has exactly the 
same digits existing in the integer n and is greater in value than n. If no such 
positive integer exists, return -1. 

 Note that the returned integer should fit in 32-bit integer, if there is a 
valid answer but it does not fit in 32-bit integer, return -1. 

 
 Example 1: 
 Input: n = 12
Output: 21
 
 Example 2: 
 Input: n = 21
Output: -1
 
 
 Constraints: 

 
 1 <= n <= 2³¹ - 1
